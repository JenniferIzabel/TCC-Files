Mostly this is a problem when tests require a special setup, e.g. a certain test configuration, running an instance of the application to test against or some (dockerized) ci-runner. Often, even today, a big challenge is matching the right style for tests, e.g. certain coding guidelines or favoring certain test methodologies, e.g. using no mocks or favoring integration tests over unit tests. In any case, a well maintained test suite is always what I am looking for, as being able to execute the existing tests and then read them for reference, is what I usually look for when first writing tests in an unfamiliar project.",""
